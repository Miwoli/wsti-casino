## Description
This project was made to pass my coding labs. It ain't beauti (yet), but it works. One day maybe I'll prepare a nice UI, or teach someone how into frontend using this project as his learning lab.

## Instalation
Right now there's portable version only, so simply unpack to folder and launch _wsti-casino.exe_

## Development
Make sure you've got Node.js (at least 12.14) with NPM. Git clone the repo, run `npm i` inside and than `npm start`. Everything should work in dev mode now.
